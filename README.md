I've been working on what I'm calling, an "Entity-Focal Package Format."

I haven't formally documented it much, but the main concepts and specifics are present in [a 2021-09-28 article I wrote, "Entity-Focal Data Package."](https://github.com/LionKimbro/lions_internet_office/blob/main/2021/users/lion/entries/2021-09-28_entity-focal-data-package.md)

For the time being, that's the best webpage to read about the format.

The best thing to do, however, is to join [the Discord.](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/LionsInternetOffice)
